# Shared Payment Token Handler

* **Handler Name:** `shared_payment_token`
* **Type:** Payment Handler Example
* **Status:** Experimental proposal

## Introduction

This handler describes a **Shared Payment Token (SPT)** flow for UCP. A platform
discovers that a business accepts scoped SPT checkout credentials, obtains buyer
consent or applies a delegated allowance, requests a token from an SPT-capable
issuer, and submits that token at checkout.

The token is a provider-neutral checkout instrument. It is scoped,
short-lived, single-use, and processor-redeemable. The handler keeps UCP-native
field names while preserving the same SPT contract around amount, currency,
business identity, checkout binding, processor route, idempotency, consent or
delegated allowance, and replay protection.

The token is not a raw PAN, CVC, network-token cryptogram, wallet secret, bank
credential, or PSP secret. It is an opaque, time-limited checkout instrument
bound to a business, checkout, amount, currency, processor route, and
idempotency key.

This example is adjacent to tokenization handlers, but the platform does not
submit raw card credentials for tokenization. The SPT issuer already holds or
can access the buyer's funding source under an approved relationship. The
platform requests a checkout token for a specific UCP transaction.

### Key Benefits

* **Portable checkout instrument:** The platform can submit one credential shape
  while the business keeps its configured processor route.
* **Reduced credential exposure:** The platform and agent never receive raw
  funding credentials.
* **Bounded agentic checkout:** Each token is scoped to one checkout context,
  amount, currency, business identity, and expiration window.

## Configuration

The business advertises this handler in its UCP profile's `payment_handlers`
registry. The checkout response remains authoritative for the final amount,
currency, processor route, and accepted token constraints.

## Platform Integration

### Prerequisites

Before using this handler, platforms must:

1. Register with an SPT issuer or wallet to obtain a platform identity.
2. Support a buyer consent or delegated allowance flow.
3. Present checkout details to the buyer or agent policy before token issuance.
4. Store and submit only the opaque checkout token returned by the issuer.
5. Handle token expiration and refresh by repeating the acquisition flow.

### Credential Acquisition

The platform requests a token for a specific checkout. The exact API is defined
by the handler provider, but requests should include the authoritative checkout
binding from the business response.

<!-- ucp:example skip reason="handler provider API, not UCP payload" -->
```json
POST /ucp/shared-payment-tokens
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "handler_id": "spt_primary",
  "instrument_type": "shared_payment_token",
  "business_id": "business_123",
  "platform_id": "platform_456",
  "funding_source_id": "funding_source_789",
  "consent": {
    "type": "delegated_allowance",
    "allowance_id": "allow_abc123"
  },
  "binding": {
    "checkout_id": "checkout_abc123",
    "amount": {
      "value": "12.00",
      "currency": "USD"
    },
    "processor": "examplepay",
    "merchant_account_id": "acct_merchant_123",
    "idempotency_key": "idem_01J4ZTKC49R2AK7Y4M6GPJCMJ2"
  }
}
```

**Response:**

<!-- ucp:example skip reason="handler provider API, not UCP payload" -->
```json
{
  "instrument": {
    "type": "shared_payment_token",
    "handler_id": "spt_primary",
    "credential_id": "spt_01J4ZTM7JVAF5J29VE1S58F7RC",
    "token": "spt_live_opaque_value",
    "display": {
      "funding_source_type": "card",
      "brand": "visa",
      "last4": "4242"
    },
    "binding_proof": "sptproof_opaque_value",
    "expires_at": "2026-07-24T18:05:00Z",
    "single_use": true
  }
}
```

### Checkout Submission

The platform submits the returned instrument to the business checkout endpoint.
The business treats the token as a payment credential for the advertised handler
and verifies the same binding used during acquisition.

<!-- ucp:example schema=checkout def=complete_request -->
```json
{
  "checkout_id": "checkout_abc123",
  "payment": {
    "handler": "shared_payment_token",
    "instrument": {
      "type": "shared_payment_token",
      "handler_id": "spt_primary",
      "credential_id": "spt_01J4ZTM7JVAF5J29VE1S58F7RC",
      "token": "spt_live_opaque_value",
      "binding_proof": "sptproof_opaque_value"
    }
  }
}
```

## Business Processing

Upon receiving this handler's instrument, businesses **MUST**:

1. Confirm the handler id matches a configured handler.
2. Validate that the checkout id, amount, currency, business id, and processor
   binding match the response configuration used for token acquisition.
3. Ensure the idempotency key has not already been used with a different
   checkout fingerprint.
4. Submit the token to the SPT issuer for verification and processing, or
   forward it to an approved PSP integration that can redeem the token.
5. Return the finalized checkout result.

### Verification Request

<!-- ucp:example skip reason="handler provider API, not UCP payload" -->
```json
POST /ucp/shared-payment-tokens/verify
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "credential_id": "spt_01J4ZTM7JVAF5J29VE1S58F7RC",
  "token": "spt_live_opaque_value",
  "binding_proof": "sptproof_opaque_value",
  "binding": {
    "checkout_id": "checkout_abc123",
    "amount": {
      "value": "12.00",

    },
    "business_id": "business_123",
    "processor": "examplepay",
    "merchant_account_id": "acct_merchant_123",
    "idempotency_key": "idem_01J4ZTKC49R2AK7Y4M6GPJCMJ2"
  }
}
```

**Response:**

<!-- ucp:example skip reason="handler provider API, not UCP payload" -->

## Security Requirements

| Requirement | Description |
| :---------- | :---------- |
| **Opaque token** | Platforms and agents receive only an opaque token and display-safe metadata. |
| **Checkout binding** | Tokens **MUST** be bound to checkout id, amount, currency, business id, and expiration. |
| **Processor binding** | If the business config requires a processor route, redemption **MUST** reject other routes. |
| **Single-use default** | Tokens **SHOULD** be single-use and short-lived. |
| **Replay protection** | Verification **MUST** bind idempotency keys to a normalized checkout fingerprint. |
| **No raw credential fallback** | Implementations **MUST NOT** expose PAN, CVC, network-token cryptograms, wallet secrets, bank credentials, or PSP secrets to platforms or agents as a fallback path. |
| **Consent traceability** | Issuance **MUST** record human consent or delegated allowance proof. |

## Error Handling

| Error | Meaning |
| :---- | :------ |
| `invalid_binding` | Checkout, amount, currency, business, or processor binding does not match. |
| `credential_expired` | Token expired before redemption. |
| `credential_revoked` | Token was revoked or invalidated. |
| `credential_replayed` | Token or idempotency key was reused with a different checkout fingerprint. |
| `unsupported_processor_route` | Business route cannot redeem this token. |
| `payment_declined` | Processor declined the payment. |
| `retryable_processing_error` | Temporary processor or network failure. |
